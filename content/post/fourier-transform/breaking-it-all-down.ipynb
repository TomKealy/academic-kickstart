    "One of the most important ideas in mathematics, is that you can build complex things out of simple things. In the context I'm talking about this time: we can often break a vector on a vector space down into a sum of simpler vectors which span the space we're interested in. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, consider the plane \\\\( \\mathrm{R}^2 \\\\) and the two vectors \\\\( e_1 = (1, 0)^T \\\\) and \\\\( e_2 = (0, 1)^T \\\\). We can write *any* vector in that plane as a sum  of those two vectors:\n",

    "This idea extends to any dimension \\\\( n > 2 \\\\). What's more amazing, is that this idea can also work for spaces with infinite dimensions! In these infinite spaces, a vector is now a function, and we seek to express the function in terms of simpler ones. "
